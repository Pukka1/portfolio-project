        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
            Jive is an animation tool that intends to break down the barriers of animation movie making. The concept of the tool will work as a full production animation tool. However, this early stage shows how aesthetics of an original image/character can be changed into a preferred aesthetic from an existing image using machine learning.

        <h4>Goal of Project</h4>
        <p>
            Intention of this project is to introduce <strong> new audience </strong> to spaces that have not been explored extensively by that audience. For this reason, I chose to focus on introducing teenagers in Ghana/West Africa to animation. Like children in any other part of the world, life as a toodler and pre teen is packed with disney and pixar movies. In some parts of the world inspiration from these animation movies spark a trajectory into building a career in the animation industry. This reality is unlikely in the Ghanaian context. There are no resources to develop interests in this already cut throat industry..
        </p>

        <p>
            Emerging technologies such as machine learning can potentially shrink the barriers to learning the complex skill sets within the animation creation process. In this project, a small part of the process is demoed in the prototype. A user develops a storyboard using preexisting photos either from a library or photos they take in the moment <strong>(content image)</strong>.The user can then transfer a style from another image <strong> (style image)</strong> to replicate its aesthetics on their original image. This machine learning process can be replicated for voice, movement of 2D/3D characters and much more.
