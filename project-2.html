        <h4> Summary </h4>
        <p>
            This project envisions a communication backpack that could allow british minorities to connect with new restaurants and other businesses of their culture origin within their vicinty. The bag has an off state and an on state. <strong>(shown here)</strong> The on state displaces a pattern the user controlls through an app to indicate their presence in a place.
